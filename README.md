# Foo-D-Mah: A Personalized Food Recommendation App

Foo-D-Mah is a high-fidelity mobile application prototype designed for the University of Minnesota's UI Design course, and is named after the university's popular "Ski-U-Mah". It tackles the challenge of finding dining options that cater to personal dietary restrictions, preferences, and real-time restaurant data, aiming to reduce decision fatigue and provide a truly user-centered discovery experience.

### **Problem Statement**

Popular food-ordering platforms often rely on generalized, advertiser-driven recommendations that overlook the specific needs of users with unique dietary patterns (like vegetarian days, allergies, or halal/kosher requirements). This forces users to sift through extensive menus and crowded reviews, often leading to decision fatigue and a repetitive cycle of uninspired choices. Foo-D-Mah was designed to solve this by integrating user-specific needs with real-time data and community insights.

### **Key Features**

* **Personalized Onboarding:** A refined setup process that allows users to specify allergies, dietary restrictions (e.g., halal, vegetarian, gluten-free), and cuisine preferences from the start.
* **Swipe-Based Discovery:** An engaging "Discover" tab that uses a Tinder-style swipe interface for users to easily like or ignore restaurant suggestions.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Recommendations are automatically filtered to match the user’s saved preferences, ensuring every suggestion is a viable option.
* **Community and Social Integration:** A cohesive review system that highlights both user and community feedback, allowing for quick scanning of key information like portion sizes and dietary compliance.
* **Picks, Collections, and Lists:** Users can save their favorite restaurants to "Picks," organize them into custom "Collections" (e.g., "Date Night," "Friend Dinners"), and review their "Explored" and "Ignored" history.

### **Technologies Used**

* **UI/UX Design:** Figma
* **User Research & Ideation:** Miro (for Affinity Mapping)

### **Our Design Process**

Our design followed a structured, three-milestone process focused on user research, iterative prototyping, and rigorous evaluation.

#### **1. Milestone 1: User Research & Ideation**

We began by conducting 6 user interviews to understand the pain points of existing food discovery platforms. Key themes emerged, such as frustration with generic recommendations, the importance of reviews, and the difficulty of finding options for specific dietary needs.

We used affinity mapping to cluster our findings and identify core user needs.

#### **2. Milestone 2: Low-Fidelity Prototyping & Heuristic Evaluation**

Based on our research, we created low-fidelity prototypes using whiteboard sketches to establish the core layout and user flow.

Our team then conducted a thorough **heuristic evaluation** based on Nielsen's 10 Heuristics. This helped us identify major usability issues early on, such as unclear icons, inconsistent layouts, and poor feedback mechanisms, before moving to a high-fidelity design.

#### **3. Milestone 3: High-Fidelity Prototype & User Testing**

We translated our refined designs into a high-fidelity, interactive prototype in Figma. Our final step was to conduct user testing sessions with real users. Testers were given a series of tasks to complete, such as updating their dietary preferences and finding a specific type of restaurant.

**Key Learnings from User Testing:**
* The swipe-based "Discover" feature was not immediately intuitive without guidance.
* Users loved the personalization features but wanted clearer iconography and labels.
* Navigation to secondary features like "Collections" needed to be more prominent.
* A strong desire for social features (sharing, friend activity) was a recurring theme.

### **Future Improvements**

Based on user feedback and our final evaluation, future iterations of Foo-D-Mah would include:
* **Onboarding Tutorial:** A brief tutorial to introduce users to key features like the swipe mechanic.
* **In-App Social Features:** Adding functionality to share restaurants with friends and see peer reviews.
* **Enhanced Visuals:** Improving restaurant cards with larger images and integrated map previews.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Introducing tag-based filters (e.g., cuisine, distance) as an alternative to the swipe interface.
